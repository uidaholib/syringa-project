I am working with residents moving out of Syringa Mobile Home Park, who need to be out of the park by the end of June 5th before the park closes. 
One resident has a fine mobile home and ALMOST everything has checked out for rehab inspection (a special type of home inspection for mobile homes built before 1976).

He is, though, having an impossible time figuring out how to get a plumbing inspection. 
Local plumbing companies don't typically do this work - he has contacted about a dozen of so businesses already in Moscow, Troy, and Pullman. 
People say that mobile home moving companies may have an idea. I am checking to see if any of you might have any ideas, in case some of you have had to move a home or know someone who is in this line of work. Would greatly appreciate your expert tips!
