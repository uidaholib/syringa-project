Over the month of May and early June 2018, I worked with Steve Bonnar (Director of Sojourners' Alliance), Lysa Salsbury (Director of UI Women's Center),

and Anne Zabala (Council Member of Moscow City Council) to raise funds for Syringa residents to help fill in any funding gaps not covered by the government programs Steve Bonnar and Sojourners' staff manage to prevent homelessness in Moscow. 
Here is one of the later posts regarding our progress seeking donations:  $3,650 raised since last Wednesday, May 23rd! 
Add the $500 that the Latah County Human Rights Commission is donating, and we've got $6,150 out of the $7,000 goal for our online fundraising campaign. 
We are meeting again Wednesday morning to figure out how to distribute funds to families. 
Their final day to move out is June 5th, a week from today.

How have donations helped families so far? One family has money to cover the moving truck rental to get their belongings to northern California. 
Another family that is trying to fix up their new house that needs lots of TLC has money for construction materials. 
Two families have money now to cover lot rent for the next month, as well as deposits. 
Others are now able to avoid late bill payment as they shift all their money to moving.

What you can't measure is the feeling that people care.
Thank you, everyone.

Donations can still be made here so we can reach our $7,000 online.
