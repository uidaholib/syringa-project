"Dr. Leontina Hormel is a professor of Sociology at the University of Idaho. Hormel has been working with Syringa residents for the past several years. Syringa was a mobile home park located three miles outside of Moscow, Idaho in Latah County. Syringa was open from 1968 to June 5, 2018. The park closed after several years of mismanagement and disinvestment from the owner. The closure of the park brought on the mass-eviction of several low-income people and families. The case of Syringa helps highlight the need for affordable housing across the nation. This website was created through the help of Olivia Wikle and the University of Idaho Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning as an undergraduate fellowship project by Denessy Rodriguez.",,
