Fundraising Effort,"""Over the month of May and early June 2018, I worked with Steve Bonnar (Director of Sojourners' Alliance), Lysa Salsbury (Director of UI Women's Center), and Anne Zabala (Council Member of Moscow City Council) to raise funds for Syringa residents to help fill in any funding gaps not covered by the government programs Steve Bonnar and Sojourners' staff manage to prevent homelessness in Moscow. Here is one of the later posts regarding our progress seeking donations:  $3,650 raised since last Wednesday, May 23rd! Add the $500 that the Latah County Human Rights Commission is donating, and we've got $6,150 out of the $7,000 goal for our online fundraising campaign. We are meeting again Wednesday morning to figure out how to distribute funds to families. Their final day to move out is June 5th, a week from today.
How have donations helped families so far? One family has money to cover the moving truck rental to get their belongings to northern California. Another family that is trying to fix up their new house that needs lots of TLC has money for construction materials. Two families have money now to cover lot rent for the next month, as well as deposits. Others are now able to avoid late bill payment as they shift all their money to moving. 
What you can't measure is the feeling that people care. 
Thank you, everyone.
Donations can still be made here so we can reach our $7,000 online"" ","May 29, 2018",doublewidemovemay2018,2018-05-29
Urgent Help!,"I am working with residents moving out of Syringa Mobile Home Park, who need to be out of the park by the end of June 5th before the park closes. One resident has a fine mobile home and ALMOST everything has checked out for rehab inspection (a special type of home inspection for mobile homes built before 1976). He is, though, having an impossible time figuring out how to get a plumbing inspection. Local plumbing companies don't typically do this work - he has contacted about a dozen of so businesses already in Moscow, Troy, and Pullman. People say that mobile home moving companies may have an idea. I am checking to see if any of you might have any ideas, in case some of you have had to move a home or know someone who is in this line of work. Would greatly appreciate your expert tips! (below is a photo of the home - I posted on behalf of the same home owner a week or so ago)","May 30, 2018",urgenthomemovemay302018,2018-05-30

"Shoutout from Anne Zabala, Moscow City Councilor","A huge shoutout to Leontina Hormel and Lysa Haskell Salsbury for their leadership in raising funds to help with the relocation efforts for Syringa residents. Together we raised almost all of the $7,000 goal for the online fundraising campaign. With staff members from Sojourners' Alliance, our committee met again to talk about how to distribute these donations in a fair and equitable way, and once again I have been blown away by the generosity of our community. However, I hope this is an important first step towards having a broader conversation about possible ways to prevent this kind of situation from happening again.

Update #3 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"I met Dawn Trottier out at Syringa with my husband Chris Nordenyesterday late afternoon (May 31, 2018). Dawn and her mother - Cookie Grandma - made rounds around the park with platters of cookies to share with residents and kids, as they pack and haul belongings. Aimee's double-wide is finally getting ready to be transported to a mobile home park in Moscow (it takes a long time to get movers in the park, even once they are set up to move you) and I will find out today if her home is now officially out of the park. Another home was sold and is in the midst of being hauled out, too. As people are moving out, the park is turning into a mess of abandoned homes and belongings. Yet, so many families are still trying to pack up so they can leave, too. I figured out yesterday -- thanks to Dawn helping me put two-and-two together -- that families are going without food as they piece together finances for moving. I need to check in with local grocery stores to see if there is any chance of getting some food to take out to the park. If you have tips for doing this swiftly (today or early tomorrow), it would be nice to make sure people have a little bit of food out there. Of course, any organization willing to take food to Syringa would be welcomed! June 5th is Syringa's last day. UPDATE 3 p.m. Friday: Vandal Food Pantry at UI donated several boxes of food for residents. BIG THANK YOU to ASUI Center for Volunteerism and Social Action.","June 1, 2018",lt&dawnjune12018,2018-06-01
Update #4 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Aimee's double-wide was moved out of Syringa late into the night Friday, June 1st. While there is still some maneuvering to do, looks like Aimee has a new location for her home and a view of the famous Palouse rolling hills. In other news, Dawn Trottier, Chris Norden, and I joined about 50 or so Latah County constituents to ask Senator Crapo questions. Dawn gave an intimate description of the damages residents have experienced, and how finding affordable housing in their beloved Latah County is near impossible with only 6 months to do it. It was beautifully articulated and straight from the heart. The three of us then drove bags of groceries, most of which was donated by ASUI's Center for Volunteerism and Social Action (thank you, Kaela Watson), to Syringa. People just don't have time or money to get rations for the upcoming days as they pack, haul belongings, and problem solve. Syringa was buzzing with a lot of hard work and a lot of tears. Many worry that June 5 is an undoable departure date for some families. Nobody knows what will happen to any of their belongings or homes after June 5th, even though they still need access to them to move completely.

Update #5 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Today is June 5, 2018, the final day Syringa is open as a community. What I have heard from legal counsel is that residents will not be legally cited for trespassing after today, so long as it is evident they are making progress toward moving out completely. It also sounds like there are plans to shut off the water June 6. When talking with residents yesterday out at Syringa, the possibility of going without water, while trying to guard their homes from scavengers, was distressing. Once again, at no fault of their own, residents may have to figure out ways to get water to drink, bathe, and flush their toilets as they wait for movers and housing plans to fall into place. Many of those still stuck in the park are simply trying to get mobile homes to their lots - so moving schedules or inspections are holding them up.  Some may ask why they didn't make these plans earlier. I give you at least three combined factors to explain the timing of moving mobile homes: 1) residents weren't sure if they were going to have any money from the bankruptcy settlement until payouts were distributed starting on March 19, 2018. 2) Syringa is located in a marshy area that is muddy through April and May. The first mobile home wasn't moved out until the second week of May, and this happened only after several failed attempts because trucks kept sinking into the mud. 3) Mental conditioning - Mr. Magar - the owner - has threatened to close before (though not with a legal notice), so residents held out hope that this really wasn't going to happen. These dimensions, plus all of the multiple challenges built into the experiences of each household, affected people's ability to plan ahead.   I add this response because I have heard different individuals remark over the past week that people in Syringa didn't plan well, which insinuates that they are the problem. Let's get this straight, especially on the last day Syringa is open, that they didn't create this mess. They paid their lot rents and followed the rules. The park owner is the one who let us down. The courts agreed, otherwise there would have been no payouts to residents. ","June 5, 2018",,2018-06-05
Update #5.5 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Dawn Trottier and I brought sandwiches, cookies, and sodas out to the last remaining households still in various stages of moving out of the park. By my count, there are four more mobile homes waiting to move (one in progress, one this Saturday (believe it when it see it), one scheduled for June 14, and yet another that is stalled in planning). Two or three households will be temporarily sheltered in area motels, then housed when apartments are available. Three plan to rehouse in RV parks in the area. One resident is moving to land and then building a house out of the scraps pulled off their trailer (an effort to leave the park owner nothing of resale value). Two or three have no destination settled yet. That's about 11 households that are in flux and, word has it, will have no water or even electricity starting tomorrow, June 6.   A few past residents came out to check in with their neighbors, or what some described as their ""extended family members."" These same folks said, despite being rehoused very nicely, they would move back to be in Syringa -- they miss the community. I felt so lucky to have time with everyone, spending about four hours taking time to hear everyone's stories, worries, and hopes.   That said, there are loads of feral cats that some are worried about leaving out. Organizations know about this and, themselves, concerned about contagious diseases feral cats may carry. One cat plucks my heartstrings big-time. She may need a home (see that lovely cutie pictured below). Her owner has a couple options that he hopes will work. But, if not, she needs a forever home. I can't take her in, despite my love for calico kitties. Anyone interested, if indeed she needs a loving home? Guaranteed loving and friendly companion.","June 5, 2018",kittyjune52018,2018-06-05
Update #6 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Yesterday was the first day Syringa was officially closed. By my count, ten residents are still housed in the park. Five are single women, who are waiting for mobile homes to be moved (2), waiting for paperwork to move into an apartment (1), or are still uncertain what to do (1). Another woman is moving with her family to a parcel of land and trying to build a home from scratch. Five are single men, who are waiting for mobile homes to be moved (3), waiting to get things moved out to then be formally considered ""homeless"" so he can get housed (1), and another waiting to see where the winds take him (1). All are placing their best foot forward to leave the lives they have known out at Syringa, a community that had worked for them and met their needs until June 5.   People have been confused about the status of services and how the trustee for the property will proceed in closing the park. Will he tell Avista to turn the power off this week? What about the water? Will residents be arrested for trespassing?
Yesterday, I spoke with the Sheriff's Department, and they are only interested in monitoring criminal activity to ensure safety for those who are still trying to get moved. In talking with an Avista representative, no orders have been made yet to turn off power and there are hopes in the offices that this request is not issued before everyone is out. No power could put resident's lives at undue risk. Nobody has a clear answer about how the park will be enclosed after residents are all moved. One service that has been removed is garbage removal - all of the residents' trash bins were removed last Friday, June 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The park yesterday was very empty and quiet. I spoke with a few folks still out there, and in some ways it felt a little more peaceful - even as people bear even greater pressure to get out. More reports ahead, as our neighbors work to leave that place called Syringa Mobile Home Park, three miles outside Moscow, Idaho...","June 7, 2018",june7street2018,2018-06-07
Update #6.5 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"the water is shut off as of mid-afternoon today, June 7, 2018. Confirmed through a couple residents. While some cases of water were distributed a little while ago, 7-8 families still are stuck out there trying to get everything wrapped up. Any organizations out there willing to donate or haul the water? Any idea if county commissioners can donate two portable toilets, now that people can't flush their toilets. Newspaper said the trustee gave folks an extension. They need this basic human service.","June 7, 2018",,2018-06-07
Update #7 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"The mission today has been dedicated to trying to get water to Syringa residents, who are stuck in the park for another week or two. After visiting Latah County offices, talking on the phone with UI Legal Aid Clinic and North Central Idaho Public Health, I still had no encouraging information. You see, to get water turned back on, or to at minimum get porta potties delivered to the park, the trustee of the property has to authorize it. As a private individual, I knew I wasn't going to have enough clout to persuade the trustee that water shut-off was making an already terrible humanitarian crisis even worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Just as I was about to post on FB an update filled with dismay, I got a phone call from Paul Kimmell, Regional Business Manager for Avista Corporation and former county commissioner. He informed me that he had contacted Latah County Commissioner Tom Lamar and they reached a decision to have Tom work on contacting the trustee to try to reach an arrangement to protect residents still out in the park. If the decision is to allow porta potties on the premises, Avista is willing to cover the costs. Porta potties may not be optimal, but it restores at least a little dignity to those who just need that little extra time to piece their moving strategies together.                                                                                                                                                                                     I know everyone following Syringa's closure are anxious to see every resident relocated safely and into housing that helps them restore more stability in their lives. It hurts to see water shut-off take place when folks only need a week or two of gracious understanding. I am grateful to see this response and generous offer unfold today from Paul Kimmell, Avista, and Tom Lamar. Here's to their success!","June 8, 2018",,2018-06-08
Update #8 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Got word that two portable toilets will be delivered to Syringa so that the remaining residents (about seven households) can deal more easily with having no running water. This is not how it should be, but I am relieved that at least this much was done over the past 48 hours. We have several hard lessons to take out of this experience and it will be important for us to discuss how to protect similar communities more effectively, be it regulating bad owners more effectively (or avoiding them all together); improving fair and affordable housing access in Latah County and Moscow; and - at minimum - having a relocation relief plan in place so things are not so ad hoc/piecemeal in the future. Important to this is to bring Syringa residents to the table and learn from their experiences.","June 9, 2018",peopleaug152016,2018-06-09
Update #9 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Visited the park to check in on residents, to confirm the porta potties were in place and functioning, and to follow up for a resident to make sure their home was not burgled last night. All checked out positively. Spoke with one resident who couldn't move his home out, since it was so rainy this weekend. He is hoping today or tomorrow will be the magic day. Another two residents are hoping to move their homes soon. Two residents are eyeballing living out of RVs for a while. And, there are a couple residents that still have no clear exit plan.                                                          Though some are trying to stay relatively positive, I did run into one resident who is currently living in a hotel as Sojourner's seeks an apartment, and is feeling so lost and distraught. This person stayed in Syringa for 11 years and enjoyed having a fairly stable, predictable life. This person feels utterly betrayed by the park owners, after so many years of promises made to improve the basics out at the park. ""Paying rent and utilities on time for 11 years meant nothing,"" said this resident. Imagine how betrayed you would feel, if you were the same person following the rules, yet you end up the person who loses their home - the park owner has never lost his home, nor seen time in jail for all of this. 
I provide a photo Chris Norden and I took today, June 11, 2018. Syringa looks more lonely by the day. Seeing residents' parting messages feels like a piece of vindication, though.","June 9, 2018",portapottyjune92018,2018-06-09
Update #10 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Things seem to be spinning in place as movers keep postponing their work with people's homes to haul them out and more belongings walk out without their legal owners. Just now, I spoke with a resident whose mobile home movers were scheduled to haul her house tomorrow, June 14. She had just found out that her mover was not coming, nor was her mover planning to come later on to haul her home. A total let-down, despite having planned this move for this date several weeks ago. This is what people are dealing with - broken promises. Another resident who was supposed to see his home moved Saturday, then ""sometime"" Monday or Tuesday, is still waiting today. On a plus side, the former resident managed to convince a different home mover to visit her place later today. Stay tuned.
Combine these delays and broken promises with another dynamic: people breaking into what they think are abandoned homes to take whatever may have value. Be wary what you buy used around Moscow and Pullman these days - some could be straight from these houses. One resident's passenger door was bashed in and the car's battery taken. You see fancy open bed pickups coming in empty, then leaving with things --- no, they aren't helping someone move out.
Anyone thinking that people aren't motivated enough to move out of the closed version of Syringa Park hasn't been there to see how much it is spiraling downward. I share two photos from today. The message on the one home is a great reflection of people's strength in the face of adversity - the resident is still waiting for a home to be moved (not this one), and still dug deep for a moment of humor.

Help Wanted!,"Help wanted! We need a couple hands to help one of the residents move the rest of her furniture and belongings out of her home!

Can YOU help us? Or, do you know a couple of high schoolers or college students who can do this? PM me (Leontina Hormel) to get information. Plans are to get out to Syringa at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow (Sunday, June 17). The more hands, the less time it will take!!

Update #11 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"I really cannot express how much gratitude I have for the help of several individuals today. At 11 a.m. - on Father's Day - Graham Stevenson brought his two sons and friend to do the heavy lifting. Latah County Commissioner Tom Lamarshowed up a little later, too. All 5 wrangled with the big appliances: refrigerator, small freezer, washer and dryer, stove, big headboard for the bed, several dressers, and several other items. They filled up the 10 ft. moving truck in just over an hour, and they drove with Chris Norden out to Troy, Idaho, to stow everything carefully into the storage - completing this within two hours. And, in the midst of this BJ and Cliff Swanson brought us a great picnic lunch! Chris and I managed to fill the truck one more time, nearly filling the storage unit in Troy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I have been fortunate to see people pitch in during such an urgent time of need. The moving isn't over, and many many people will need folks to extend help as they try to recover financially and get settled in. People, like the resident we helped today, will need folks to help her move her belongings back to her home. It would be tremendous help to me if some of you would be willing to pitch in to organize recruiting some hands in the future - especially to spread the volunteer help out :) Please let me know if you would be willing to take the lead on recruiting hands for this resident, and maybe one or two others.
Thank you, again, for the wonderful gift that you gave us today on a Sunday AND a Father's Day. It was tough work, and it made a huge difference in this woman's life.","June 17, 2018",streetjune172018,2018-06-17
Update #12 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"All the packing and moving paid off from last weekend - the home was officially moved out of Syringa this morning. Hurray! This is such a relief, since theft and burglary have intensified in the park. The story of individuals making money off people, who are in their deepest time of need, is not a new one, not even in Moscow and Latah County. What has been fascinating and grim, as I have been in touch with Syringa residents over the past three years, is the elaborate moneymaking system that has been created to take advantage of people in dire circumstances. If you haven't been exposed to these stories before, I recommend you read Matthew Desmond's Pulitzer Prize winning book Evicted (published in 2016). Thankfully, this resident's home was moved before someone busted into it. And, she pulled down her fencing before someone stole it.                                                                                                                                                                             This story is important for understanding why some residents have not managed to move out yet. Some are afraid to leave their homes to move things to new places, since they might be the next victims of burglary and theft. One man has stuck around, slowing down his and his family's move, because he is worried for the remaining single women who are working on getting out of the park and also about leaving his place vulnerable to thieves. As more residents -- eyes on the streets -- leave, the more this vulnerability has increased.

I am relieved to see homes geared up for getting out of the park, and I am so anxious to see all the families leave safely and without too much more feelings and experiences of loss.

Update #13 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"June 22, 2018, marks the final day of the extension granted to Syringa residents following the June 5th closure. Several residents over this period have had the opportunity to continue moving their belongings and deconstructing valuable construction materials off their homes. Over this period, three more mobile homes were moved off the premises to other parks.                            There remain several households still making big pushes to move out completely. Six households have places, but still have not been able to move everything. I understand that at least three will be completely moved by Sunday night. Two residents are waiting for mobile homes to be moved - it is a matter of just one more week, and they should be out. But, they need those precious days without further barriers. And, there remain three residents without a clear path. Sojourner's Alliance and I are communicating regularly with all these households, and we strive to help with the best solutions for each resident. The final count seems to be 5 households finishing their moves and 6 households still in flux.                                                                                                                    At this point, I want to make it clear that the moving company doing most of the work with residents' mobile homes has proven to be incredibly committed to residents. In fact, the owner told Chris and me last week that he has set aside all other jobs to make sure Syringa residents were first in line for his service. He said he had a dozen other jobs pending, so this is a major community contribution on his part. I will be writing a letter to Moscow-Pullman Daily News with names of individuals and organizations that have made the difference , and making sure residents help me with that list!

Syringa is emptying out. People are motivated and planning. What lies ahead in the coming days and week(s) remains to be seen.

Update #14 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"In the midst of residents reporting that more strangers were scavenging through people's things out at the park, a piece of great news from yesterday --- one more resident's mobile home is officially moved out of the park. That leaves one more resident waiting for a home to be moved out and another resident waiting on a home in another park to be moved to another site. When visiting briefly today, it is evident people are busy trying to finish up moving their belongings. And, others are simply stalled waiting for confirmation on their next home destination. No word what comes next in terms of the park closure, but progress proceeds step-by-step at Syringa, three miles outside Moscow, Idaho.","June 23, 2018",,2018-06-23
Update #15 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"I have not visited the park since Monday, but have been on the phone with three (of the five) residents trying to move out of Syringa still.

I am hoping Patty can have some new volunteers out at the park to help her out. Do you want to help? Or, do you know some folks or organizations who can pitch in? Please PM me (Leontina Hormel) with your ideas and contact info!

As far as I can tell, the other residents are physically able to do their packing and moving, and have some support networks.

Update #15.5 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"I want to report on the great work Latah County Sheriff Richard Skiles and officers are doing out at the park these days. Two of the women residents today told me they are feeling a lot safer in the park, even at night, largely because the patrolling is regular and thoughtful. Not only that, one of the women said that Sheriff Skiles has been helping her in ways that go beyond his duties - finding people to fix her motor home so it can be moved somewhere else for storage, locating an affordable housing opportunity at one of the apartment complexes, and just plain treating her like a good human being. Last week's reports about theft in the park revealed the complexity of trying to manage park closure of this magnitude. It is a difficult job, and Latah County Sheriff's Department is stepping up to the task. When you see them, be sure to thank them. I sure will!

THANK YOU! -- Leontina Hormel","June 27, 2018",,2018-06-27
Update #16 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"I slowed down my check-ins at the park for the past two weeks. The residents still moving out of the park and living in the park are making progress, but it is slow. One resident, for instance, moved her RV trailer out of the park for close to a month, but has returned and only now has found an RV lot that she will rent for a month. Several residents found RV living the best solution given the fact that $575 RV lot rent is still less expensive than trying to rent an apartment in Moscow. One resident, who has had his mobile home ready to move to another lot he has reserved, continues to wait for the mover to take his home. The mover has been fantastic, but the motor in his moving truck has been going out frequently, which has slowed down fulfilling this order and the dozen or so others he has on his schedule. Another resident has purchased a mobile home in another park, but is waiting for that home to be moved to yet another park. Even when mobile homes arrive in their lots, residents have had to wait two+ weeks to get all the hookups and inspections passed before inhabiting their homes. As far as I can tell, four residents are living full-time in the park right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Another four (maybe one or two more) households are still hauling stuff out. This may raise questions for some - why are people STILL hauling things out? Well, a lot of these folks lived in the park for 10-20 years, so they accumulated a bunch of things. On top of that, they are hauling things using pickups and econo cars, and they are moving to places like Potlatch and Bovill. They are crossing significant distances and doing it when they are not working and have the gas money for another trip.

I read the M-P Daily News article this morning about theft. This degree of theft (other than Jim's beautifull '55 Chevy being stolen - thankfully found again) has been bad for a while. The Sheriff's Department has increased its presence and residents out at the park are very happy about it. Sheriff Skiles has been fantastic (one more shout out). Even before June 5, the official closing date, people were talking about people driving through and gawking at them; some of these gawkers were likely there for a little ""poverty porn"" (what some residents were calling it and a concept used in academic literature), but people also knew some were casing the area for things of value. Syringa has felt familiar to my research visits in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. During that period, it was widely observed -- especially in rural areas -- that people scavenged for construction materials and copper wiring, or any other valuable item. Sheriff Skiles described scenes in Syringa that are similar to what I, and other journalists and scholars, were discouraged to see happening throughout places like Russia and Ukraine. This is part of an underground economy that middle class families don't ever have to experience - people making a business off the backs of low income people's misfortunes. And, it is also how low income people try to help cover the expenses of home renovations and to get a small amount of cash in their hands.

What may have been lost in the article, is James Ware's remark that the residents still out at the park came together and worked their butts off to locate his stolen '55 Chevy. I want that to sink in. Even in the wake of home loss and grief, the few that remain took care of each other. This is a piece of how things were when Syringa was still intact, not a closed place with no running water. Imagine how hard it will be for people to recreate this community in a new place. That is what hurts a lot.

Update #17 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Well, just found out that one of the residents who was all set to move into a subsidized two-bedroom apartment lost the deal. She is back to square one, and following up on the few leads that exist in the area. Cross your fingers, everyone. She is living among boxes right now, just needing a 2-bdrm to squeeze her house-worth's belongings into an apartment. It clearly isn't easy to move, even when all things seem set. ","July 19, 2018",,2018-07-19
Update #17.5 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"I reported earlier that one of the residents' opportunity for a 2-bdrm apartment fell through. She is working new opportunities, but this means she is still out at the park. We visited the park today. The garbage clean-up Moscow Recycling organized Tuesday morning was obvious. The piles of perishable items, plus some of the loose debris were largely gone! That was the only change, though. All of the residents I have mentioned in the past are still stuck waiting for things to fall in place. That means at least five people are still working on ways to move out of the park officially. Nobody knows what the next steps will be, in terms of the park's trustee's actions. Meanwhile, friends and advocates for Syringa residents are keeping an eye on things to make sure support is available. Thanks, everyone, for following the latest happenings in Syringa.","July 19, 2018",,2018-07-19
Update #18 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Two weeks ago I submitted a brief update about residents. At the time, about six households were still working on permanent relocation, while four or more households were continuing to move belongings out of their Syringa homes to their new homes.                                                                                                                                                                                                               One woman, as of today, has signed her apartment lease and officially has keys to her new apartment in Moscow! I am working with a kind Moscow community member right now, who thinks he can round up a few guys to help her move her things this weekend. This is GREAT news!

Five other residents continue to make progress, but are not relocated in a new housing situation yet. For instance, the mobile home that one man has been waiting patiently to be moved out to the lot he has reserved elsewhere is still in Syringa. Another resident is trying to fix up a mobile home in another park so that it passes inspection - she is working tirelessly on it. Each of the remaining residents has to deal with complex puzzle pieces that will enable them to move successfully. Some of their plans will result in continued precarious housing situations, so patience allows them to secure more sustainable opportunities.

And, people continue to work on moving things out, as their work schedules and gas money allow.

It is dry and hot. Harvest work and road construction raise loads of dust in the area. This is August 8 on the Palouse, three miles outside Moscow. Below, I have posted one photo from March 25, 2015, to give folks an idea of what the public rec center and playground were like when Syringa had on-site management and, thus, when the grounds were maintained. The other two photos were taken today, showing what a difference more than a year of off-site management and park closure can make. So much has changed, most especially with the loss of community.

Update #19 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"HELP NEEDED: A resident needs help moving a storage shed and belongings to her new home in Moscow. Here is her description of what would help her make the final push to get out: ""I need a truck and a flat bed trailer at least 8 ft wide and 10 ft long to haul a shed possibly a deck and stairs for me. Also 3 to 4 big guys to do some heavy lifting plant pots, shed ...etc.""

Update #20 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"HELP NEEDED SUNDAY: Does anyone out there have a pickup with a hitch that could help a resident move her 21-foot camper trailer out of Syringa this Sunday? It only needs to be moved to Rambler RV Park, which is on Troy Hwy off Carmichael Road - just outside of Moscow city limits. Thank you to anyone who can make this happen!

Update #21 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Andy Carman brought his daughter Stella, her boyfriend, and a couple more friends out to the park today to help Chris and me move Patty's belongings to her new digs in Moscow. She found a great place to live and should be able to live there sustainably, thanks to qualifying for affordable housing AND having good timing. We are stoked!                                                                    Today, too, one of the other single women residents was celebrating her birthday by moving a few more things, though still she is waiting for pieces to fall in place. 
By my count, four people (one of whom is simply waiting for his trailer to be moved) are left without secured housing. 
One of the four needs people's help - I will send out a reminder as Update #21.5.

Update #22 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Great news! Six volunteers lent one of the residents their trucks and some muscle to haul out a garden shed, a couple wooden staircases, and some big potted plants. Russell Paul generously brought his big flatbed trailer, and amazing skills backing that rig into any narrow slot (truly impressive). This resident has really spiffed up her new home out at Appaloosa Court -- tons of labor hours have been poured into this effort to relocate -- and this was the heavy stuff she couldn't manage on her own. A major step forward to having a new home.

Update #23 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"The last update I shared was too long ago - August 22nd. People (three, I believe) are still transitioning, and cold temperatures are descending into the region. Andrea Dickerson needs some additional help in meeting code requirements for her new home in Appaloosa Court. She cannot stay in her new home until she meets code, so she is still sleeping overnight at the park. Neither place has heating. Below, I list Andrea’s latest needs so that you can consider how you, or others you know, may be able to pitch in. Please connect with me, and I can share contact information so you can communicate directly with Andrea. Andrea works 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. shifts, so she is trying to complete this work as she works full-time. Thank you to everyone who has helped over the past year – all of your efforts matter.

Andrea has contacted community action, though it appears this has not led to any assistance yet.
1. Windows in the new home need to be replaced. Andrea has the windows, but needs help installing them and fixing the casings on some of them.
2. Her roof needs work, and she may have found materials to replace the old roof. 
3. She needs help getting a solid, safe heating source.
4. She has to finish building a fence that is almost done. Ground is very hard, so she picked up an auger to do the remaining post holes, but it is missing a part that she is locating.

She is so close to getting this home set up. Thank you for helping! ","October 5, 2018",oct52018postimage,2018-10-05
Update #23.5 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Just got back from visiting one of the residents - Jim - out at the park with my husband Chris. Jim has managed to move some of his big stuff out and is working on doing a yard sale of his treasured goods asap. Hopes to move very soon. While out there, Sheriff Skiles came by and chatted with us. Things are fairly calm and quiet at the park these days, and the fall chill is pressing people to move, so long as they have a plan. Another woman resident is on the verge of being completely moved, so that is really good news. Otherwise, it is pretty quiet out there. Broken windows and other damages keep cropping up. The Recreation Center windows are all busted now, which is a fairly new change. Over and out, 'til the next update. Hopefully, I can report that the individuals I have been following are safe and sound in new homes.  ","October 5, 2018",,2018-10-05
Update #24 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"It sounds like the sun is setting on this chapter of Syringa this Monday, November 19, 2018. The property will no longer be open for any former residents or visitors without risk of trespassing charges. Evictions will be pursued. What this will look like exactly, though, is still unknown. Will the park be completely barricaded? Will residents be able to retrieve any of their valuables still waiting for means to haul them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          These questions are important for one individual who, despite making arrangements to have his home moved many months ago, still has not seen it budge. There are promises to have the home moved this Sunday. Please send your positive thoughts his way, since he and his son have worked hard to get it out, but to no avail.                                                                                                    I can confirm that the portable toilets and handwashing station are gone. So, things are definitely winding down.
I went to visit Jim, and hope to again tomorrow. I have been welcomed by so many Syringa folks over the past few years, it is with very mixed emotions to be visiting the near-empty park now. I am happy to report that Jim has good friends in Montana helping him haul some of the last few bits that he will piece together into a home over with them. Cool guys. So, I asked my husband Chris Norden to get a photo of me and Jim hanging out at his place.

Update #25 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Chris and I visited Jim again this late afternoon. He said he delayed his departure for a few reasons, but one story that stuck out was that he visited his daughter yesterday. He said it was intended to be a quick visit, which turned into spending an afternoon watching football on the TV with her. Going to Montana is tough for Jim, as he is moving away from his kids. His kids are pretty much adults now, but he has a tough time knowing how often he will get to see them once he is in Montana.                                                                                                                                          Andrea Dickerson is still trying to get a furnace running in her new home. Her windows leak terribly, so she isn't sure how well the house will heat without windows replaced. And, she is looking for some strong folks to help her haul out a small deck to her new home. All of this on the eve of full closure rumored to happen tomorrow, November 19. I can get you in touch with Andrea if you have a way to help in such quick notice.
And, sadly, the home that has been ready to move for several months now is STILL waiting to be moved as of 4:30 this afternoon. 
Who knows what happens tomorrow, though I am sure there will be reports in the newspaper, community leaders, and from me - in some order.

Update #26 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"Today is the day evictions were to be issued to remaining Syringa residents, which by my estimation could affect three or four individuals. Chris and I drove out there this afternoon to see if any activity seemed apparent, planning only to drive by, just in case legal orders were in place to prohibit entrance into the park. We were in luck. Sheriff Skiles and Jim were parked near the entrance talking, so we pulled into the entryway and I hightailed it over to their cars to find out the latest news. As of this afternoon, the Sheriff's Department has received no formal orders to proceed with eviction notices. Maybe the order will arrive tomorrow, or Wednesday, or who knows? But, no evictions today. I asked Sheriff Skiles if he had any sense of what type of actions will take place beyond his department issuing evictions. He said he has no clue yet - things have been quite ambiguous. Meanwhile, the one home that waits to be moved is still sitting in the same place - in the exact same condition it has been since its owner moved out thinking it was a matter of a week or two before it was hauled to its new park lot. ","November 19, 2018",backyardmountainviewoct142018,2018-11-19
Update #27 from Syringa Mobile Home Park,"At last!!! The mobile home that has been sitting patiently in the park since late June 2018 has MOVED! Andrea Dickerson gave me the heads up, and the owner's son confirmed. There is still a lot of work involved getting the home up to code in its new lot, but it was such a relief to find out that this home was not lost. I also contacted Sheriff Richie Skiles just now to find out what the latest word is about evictions. Nothing has been issued yet, even though there were multiple signals given the week before Thanksgiving. Sheriff Skiles said the bankruptcy court has issued a summons as of this morning to his office, which means he and his office will be issuing a 21-day summons to those who are still out in Syringa (about three people now). If need be, residents can appeal for more time. If they do not appeal, and do not move out, in 21 days, then an eviction notice of 48 hours will be issued. This seems a reasonable compromise, offering a definite deadline for everyone via the courts.
